# HyPrism

A multiplatform Hytale launcher with mod manager and more!

## Installation

### Windows
Download `HyPrism.exe` from [releases](https://github.com/yyyumeniku/HyPrism/releases/latest) and run.

### macOS
**Important**: Since the app is not code-signed, macOS will show a "damaged" warning. To fix:
1. Open the downloaded DMG file
2. Run `Fix-HyPrism.command`

### Linux
See [LINUX.md](LINUX.md) for detailed installation instructions. **TL;DR:** Use Flatpak for best compatibility.

## Platform Support
- ✅ Windows (fully supported)
- ✅ macOS (ARM64, Intel)
- ⚠️ Linux (Flatpak recommended, AppImage has dependency issues)
